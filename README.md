![Screenshot 2024-09-15 101758](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b0b6dfaf-2cff-473d-a3e3-9c01c67e584b)


In the highly competitive telecom industry, customer retention has become more crucial than ever. Customer churn, which occurs when users switch to a different provider, can have a significant impact on a company’s financial performance. This project aims to develop a predictive model that identifies customers likely to churn based on their usage behavior, patterns, and other relevant factors. By understanding these behaviors, companies can take proactive measures to enhance customer satisfaction and reduce churn.

The repository contains everything needed to analyze customer churn, including the dataset and the code for making predictions. It also provides valuable insights into the key factors contributing to customer attrition and offers strategies to help telecom companies improve customer retention

## Problem Statement

In the ever-evolving telecommunications industry, customers have the freedom to choose from a wide array of service providers for their communication and internet needs. Customer satisfaction is critical, as a single negative interaction can shape their perception of an entire company. Given the pervasive role that communication services play in our daily lives, understanding and addressing customer churn becomes essential.

The churn rate, which measures the number of customers who cancel or fail to renew their subscriptions, has a direct impact on a company’s revenue. Considering the high cost of acquiring new customers, a thorough churn analysis is crucial. By gaining insights from this analysis, companies can develop targeted strategies, focus on high-risk customer segments, improve service offerings, and build stronger customer relationships. Ultimately, using predictive models and detailed churn reports plays a key role in achieving sustainable growth and minimizing the effects of churn..
